# Godot Tower Defense (Name subject to change)

This game aims to marry all the best parts of challenging and caotic couch co-op games with tower defense games.

### Core gameplay

Players must work as a team to manufacture ammunition and keep their towers running and able to defend against waves of enemies.

##### Towers

 - Normal Type
 The normal tower requires players to assemble the ammo and fill a magazine before delivering it to the tower

 - Electric tower
 The electric tower uses electricity to slow down enemies. It runs on batteries, and the player must keep the battery charged by removing it and placing it on a charger. Be careful not to overcharge the battery, though. It can have disastrous effects!

 - AOE Tower
 The AOE tower delivers damage to all enemies in an area around its target. It has big and heavy ammunition. Players move slowly while transporting it.

##### Enemies

 - Normal type
 Normal enemies have no particular strengths or weaknesses they are susceptible to damage by normal towers, slowing by the electric towers, and explosions from the AOE towers.

 - Fast type
 Fast enemies move very quickly, but are weak against the electric type tower being slowed very dramatically by them. They're resistant to explosions from the AOE tower and have low health

 - Slow type
 Slow enemies move very slowly, but are weak to the AOE tower. They're resistant to slowing from the electric tower and have a high health.
